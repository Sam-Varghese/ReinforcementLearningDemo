This project is made in [Python](https://python.org). Turtle graphics is used. Reinforcement learning is used to land the rover in the best place possible. Rewards corresponding to the landing points get assigned automatically. Based on the discount factor user inputs, the rover figures out the best landing point.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `python3 main.py` in cmd
3. Enter the discount factor
4. Watch the rover land
